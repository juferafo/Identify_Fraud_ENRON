    "# Project: Identify Fraud from Enron Email\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ENRON case was one of the most important financial scandals in the history of EEUU. The ENRON corporation emerged in 1985 as a result of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth fusion. The company started as regular energy enterprise that after the legislation of energy deregularization laws began to build a complex financial business model. This, together with unethical methods such false accounting records to hide failed invesments were the key to obtain revenues of nealy 101\\$ billion during the year 2000. ENRON was the biggest company at that time employing more than 21000 people with invesments all over 40 countries. In summer of 2000 the price per action reached the peak value around 90\\$, one year and half later the company declared bankrupcy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify persons of interest (POI) among the employees of ENRON. We will consider POI as any individual who was responsible of any finantial irregularity that led to the corporation's bankrupcy. To do so, we are provided with a dataset which contains finantial and email-related data such as: salary, long term bonus, stock information and POI status. We will apply machine-learning techniques to train a predictive model able classify employees into POIs/non POIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is organized as follows: in Section I we provide a description of the dataset and the prodecure employed to identify and remove outliers. Feature selection and different machine learning algorithms are explained in Section II where we perform a comparison between different classifiers based on statistical metrics such as average score, recall or precission. Finally, parameter tuning is perfom over the best model found to improve its efficiency."

    "#### Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the analysis by providing some insight into the ENRON dataset stored in ```./final_project_dataset.pkl```. Since this file contains human-entered data it is necessary to preprocess it to correct possible errors like incomplete or wrong information. After cross-checking the data with published records (```./enron61702insiderpay.pdf```) three errors were observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The entries 'TOTAL' and 'THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK' do not refer to any individual. In the case of 'TOTAL' we can assume that it is a spread-sheet error produced while exporting the data. As shown in Fig. 2, this point is a clear  outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The features of 'BHATNAGAR SANJAY' and 'BELFER ROBERT' were incorrectly filled. The data was corrected and updated with the method ```correct_data``` defined in ```./modules/data_cleaning.py```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data of 'LOCKHART EUGENE E' is empty. This point will be automatically removed by the ```featureFormat``` method when transforming the raw data into a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 144 valid entries with 19 features related to finantial (such as salary, bonus, total stock value, etc...) and email information (messages to POIs, messages from POIs). POI or non-POI is the label that we are going to use to binary-classify the employees. Since only 19 of 144 employees are POIs the data-classes is strongly unbalanced. This aspect will be important during the validation of the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness of the data is ussually a problem while working with real-word data. The bar plot shown in Fig. 1 depices the number of NaNs per feature. Fields like 'poi',  'restricted stock value' or 'total payments' are the ones with least amount of empty data in contrast with 'loan advances', 'director fees' or 'restricted stock deferred'. The precense of NaN values has a direct effect in the quality of a given feature and will influence which features to choose while training the algorithm.\n",

    "Outliers identification is esential to distinguish data points that are far away from the general trend an may affect negalively the outome of the study. A first approach can be done just by exploring the dispersion of different features. Fig. 2 shows the dependence between bonus, salary, exercised_stock_options and total_stock_value with and without outliers.\n",

If so, we can perform a linear regression and compare the predicted bonus (exercised_stock_options) of a given salary (total_stock_value). Those points with bigger deviation (10% of the data) could be considered outliers. As shown in Fig. 3, by removing these points we obtain a better R$^2$ coefficient.\n",

    "### Section 2: Machine learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "During this section we are going to discuss the machine learning code and steps employed to build the classification model. The basic structure of the machine learning algorithm is the following: split the data into train and test sets, fit the selected classificator with the train data and evaluate the model with the test data. Also one must to take into account the number of features considered, type of model (Naive Bayes, SVM, Decission Tree...) and their parameters.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is cleaned from NaNs and outliers, it is important to select the relevant number of features to be considered in the classification. This is one possible way to tune the bias-variance tradeoff. An extremely simple model with a small number of features (bias) will have a low performance in both train and test data and, on the other hand, a complex one (variance) will describe better the particularities of the trainig set but will not be accurate in the test part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can select the k-best number of features from the dataset using the tool ```sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest```. This was implemented inside of the ```get_kbest_features``` definition inside ```./modules/ML_methods.py```. The ```SelectKBest``` methods provides a coefficient related with the importance of the feature. In Table 3 we higlight the 10 most relevant features found.     \n",

    "#### Feature engeneering\n",

    "From the best features obtained in the prevous part I build new fields with the intention to provide new relevat information to classify the employees. To do so, I selected the four ones with biggest scores: 'total_stock_value', 'exercised_stock_options', 'bonus' and 'salary' to construct 'salary_bonus' and 'total_value'. 'salary_bonus' was calculated by adding 'salary' and 'bonus' fields. 'total_value' represents the total amount of 'salary', 'bonus' and 'total_stock_value' of an employee. I choose these three values assuming that a potential POI would have a large salary and bonus as well as a big amount of money from the stock market. In Tables 3-4 we show a comparison of the 10 best features with and without the 'salary_bonus' and 'total_value' fields.\n",

The effectiveness of the model is computed from the mean value of different statistical metrics obtained for all the folds. CV is broadly used to improve the model generalization.
